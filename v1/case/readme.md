## Simple 3D Printable Case
This case has been designed to be easily printed on any size FDM 3D printer. No supports, rafts or brims are required and all the pieces will 
print equally well in PLA or PETG using a .2mm layer height. In order to make this as easy as possible to print, the "tower" component (intended to house the LED at the
top) was printed separately and can be aligned with the hole in the top of the main case and glued with any "crazy glue". The "tower align" component 
can be printed and used to make it easier to get a perfect alignment if needed.

The Dome component fits over the LED at the top of the tower and glues in place. It is intended to be printed in a clear filament like Clear PETG and
acts as a defuser for the LED (and looks kinda cool).
